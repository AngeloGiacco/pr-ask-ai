### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download all the files (`manifest.json`, `content.js`, `styles.css`)
2. Create a folder for the extension
3. Add some basic icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 PNG files named `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`)

## Output Format

The extension formats the diff like this:

```
PR Diff: [PR Title] (#123)

[filename1.py]
+ added line content
- removed line content
  unchanged line content

[filename2.js]
+ another added line
- another removed line

```

## Technical Details

- **Permissions**: Only requires `activeTab` and `clipboardWrite`
- **Content Script**: Runs only on GitHub PR pages
- **Manifest Version**: 3 (latest Chrome extension standard)

## Troubleshooting

- **Button not appearing**: Make sure you're on a GitHub PR page and refresh the page
- **No diff copied**: Ensure you're on the "Files changed" tab or that the PR has file changes
- **Styling issues**: The extension matches GitHub's current design system but may need updates if GitHub changes their UI

To modify the extension:

1. Edit the relevant files (`content.js` for functionality, `styles.css` for appearance)
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the refresh icon for this extension
3. Refresh the GitHub page to see changes
